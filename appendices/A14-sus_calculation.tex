\section{SUS Score Calculation}
\label{app:sus_calculation}

SUS scores were calculated using the standard method as described by \textcite{MeasuringSUS2011}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Subtract 1 from the score of each odd-numbered item (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
  \item Subtract the score of each even-numbered item (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) from 5.
  \item Sum the ten adjusted values (resulting in a value from 0 to 40).
  \item Multiply the sum by 2.5 to obtain the final SUS score (range 0â€“100).
\end{enumerate}

The SUS is an index and should not be interpreted as a percentage. Higher scores indicate better perceived usability.
