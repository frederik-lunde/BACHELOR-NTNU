\section{Requirements After Stakeholder Clarification Meeting}
\label{app:req_from_stakeholder}

\section*{Introduction}

This appendix presents the updated requirement list following our clarification meeting with Headspin AS  (see Section~\ref{subsec:req_stakeholder}). The conversation helped us understand user roles more clearly and led to two new functional requirements related to personalised dashboards (F7–F8). Non-functional requirements remained unchanged.

These updates formed the basis for the prototype we built in the next phase; see Appendix~\ref{app:prototype} for how the requirements developed further.
