\section{Requirements After Prototype Test}
\label{app:req-prototype}

\section*{Introduction}
The first round of hands-on prototype testing (see Section \ref{subsec:user_testing}) gave us clearer insight into what worked and what didnâ€™t; especially when it came to layout and navigation. Based on this feedback, we added one new functional requirement (F9) and one non-functional requirement (NF5) to address issues with filtering and visual clarity.

These updates were carried forward into the next development phase and shaped the version that was later tested as our MVP; see Appendix~\ref{app:req_mvp_user_test}.
